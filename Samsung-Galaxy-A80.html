    <h2 style="text-align: center"><u>Highlights</u></h2>

    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">Samsung Galaxy A80 is a new dimension in the smartphone industry with a revolutionary rotating main camera. Now, this is not the first time that we see a rotating camera phone. In fact, way back in 2013, Oppo introduced Oppo N1, the first rotating camera phone of the world. However, there is a massive difference in the quality, of course. Galaxy A80 of 2019 is coming with a much better, flagship-level camera with advanced features and technology.

Usually, the front camera of a phone is quite insignificant compared to the back camera. The idea of a single rotating camera doesn’t only give you an excellent front camera, but it also unifies the concept of smartphone photography. A triple main 48+8 megapixel plus a TOF 3D camera can be used both on the back and on the front. There are wide and ultrawide lenses to give a different and broader perspective. The sharpness, edge detection, color accuracy, exposure everything are of premium level. However, the quality is still a bit behind compared to flagships like Galaxy S10 and S10+. Of course those phones have much weaker front cameras and the rotaing technology is missing. So, its about balance and adjustments.

We have got 4K video recording facility, gyro-EIS for Full HD recordings, super-slow-motion, night mode and tons of other features for vloggers. If photography, video recording, vlogging with excellent performance are your main priorities, Samsung Galaxy A80 is the phone to choose in 2019.

Yes, we are talking about 8 GB RAM, Adreno 618 GPU, up to 2.2 GHz octa-core CPU and a Snapdragon 730 chipset. Now, you may think that the Snapdragon 700 series is inferior to the 800 series. So, it is not a pure flagship. Well, here we have got an 8 nm chipset which means it is, in fact, faster than many of the older 800 series chipset. If you are concerned about PUBG play in HD quality, be relaxed because it will run as smooth as peanut butter. 25W super fast charging will allow you to charge the 3700 mAh decent battery in around an hour. It is however one of those typical one day battery.

Let us not forget about the wonderful 6.7 inches Full HD+ Super AMOLED display with a 3rd generation Gorilla Glass protection. The backside has a Gorilla Glass 6 and the frames are made of aluminum. It is premium in all sense when it comes to design and also outstanding for viewing experience. After all, we are talking about a 6.7 inches Samsung Super AMOLED screen.

Then we have features like in-display fingerprint sensor, Samsung Knox security, biometric face unlock, Dolby Atmos sound, 128 GB internal storage, Bixby, Samsung Pay and Full HD wireless screen mirroring option with smart TVs. These are some superb specs. However, there is no 3.5mm jack, so, you need to get a Bluetooth headphone or earphone solution. There is also no MicroSD slot from extending memory. The phone is also not waterproof, which are some of the definite drawbacks considering the price factor. But we guess Samsung had to cut off a few features to implement the rotating camera and still catch the market.</p>
