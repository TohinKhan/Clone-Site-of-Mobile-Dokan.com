    <h3>Durable Body & Modern Design</h3>

    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">Nokia 8.1 comes with Snapdragon 710 (10nm) chipset. You may think that it goes to the mid-range category. But in reality, it performs very similarly to the flagship Snapdragon 835 chipset. Nokia’s software optimization and simplified Android One OS will let the phone perform even faster. You may not see any lag for day to day use. Gaming and multitasking are pretty smooth and Adreno 616 will provide upper-level graphics experience with no interruption in frame rates. There is no overheating issue, but if you use graphics related apps or the camera app for long sessions without any brake, the backside will get warm. So, make sure to take brakes to increase the durability of the phone.

        The 3500 mAh battery is impressive with 18W fast charging option. An 18W charger is also included in the box. You will go through about one and a half day with one single charge as an average tech-dependent modern user. But if you use two SIM cards instead of one, the battery performance can drop up to 40-50%. So, it is not the best battery phone for dual-SIM users.
        
        The 6.18” Full-view edge-to-edge screen is an excellent fit for regular hands. The frames are made of strong metal. Front and back side are protected by glass. Nokia used NEG scratch and damage-resistant glass in the display. But it is not as strong as the newer generation Gorilla Glass which was expected for the price. The notch is also unnecessarily big. But the Full HD+ so-called PureDisplay is a charm for reading or watching. The color contrasts, under sunlight, viewing and media quality looks outstanding.
        
        Both front and the back camera are among the most striking features of Nokia 8.1. Lighting, clarity, focus, diversity, harmony and balance of colors in the environment are of high-grade. Nokia’s Zeiss optics will show its class in the back camera. There is also 4K Ultra HD video recording, video and image stabilization which works great. Low-light shots are pretty impressive too. We were overall delighted with both cameras.
        
        Despite some elegant features, Nokia 8.1 comes with a few strong disadvantages. First of all, it is priced 44,000 Tk. in Bangladesh upon its release in January 2019. It is double the price than in China (1800 Chinese Yuan, about 22,300 Tk.). In India, it costs 26,999 Rupee (about 32,000 Tk.). Of course, high import tax and logistics or shipment to Bangladesh plays a role, but we still find it is way overpriced compared to legally imported phones from other brands in the local market. Flagship phone like OnePlus 6 is officially available at a reduced price of 44,990 Tk. with 8 GB RAM, 128 GB ROM, Snapdragon 845 chipset, Gorilla Glass 5 and waterproof body. Nokia 8.1’s 4 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM, Snapdragon 710, no waterproof or gorilla glass sound very inferior compared to it. Even Xiaomi Pocophone F1 sounds much more attractive with its pricing and performance specs. But if you want one of a kind authentic premium camera & video recording, the smooth taste of Android One with three years software update, the durability of hardware and software with a great display, Nokia 8.1 is still a solid choice.
