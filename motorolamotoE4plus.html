    <h2 style="text-align: center"><u>Highlights</u></h2>

    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">Motorola used to be one of the top-most trustworthy names in the mobile phone industry along with Nokia and BlackBerry in the early days. But with the rise of Chinese brands, they went far behind in the competition. But they didn’t give up and came back strongly since 2017 with some catchy releases like Nokia. Motorola Moto E4 Plus is among the finest low-mid range releases in Bangladesh. Let us explain why in this short review.
<br><br>
        At the first look, it didn’t grab our attention at all. It is coming with a regular mediocre design with no full-view or notch display. The body looks pretty fat and unsmart. But they say, “don’t judge a book by its cover” which kind of applies in this device. When we looked at the specs carefully, we found it to be a highly interesting gadget. The body is made of aluminum metal which is almost non-existent in this price range. The display is protected by a 3rd generation Gorilla Glass as well as oleophobic coating. It is also water-repellant, means splashes and light rain will not harm the body. It is a pretty impressive build in this price range, in fact, our current top favorite. 5.5″ HD display will provide adequate viewing experience.
      <br><br>  
        Moto E4 Plus has a massive 5000 mAh battery with fast charging. It is offering THE BEST BATTERY for the low-mid range consumers for now. You will easily get two days or more backup with one single charge. The huge battery will charge from 0 to 100% in about 3 hours through fast charging. If the battery is your biggest concern and the price matches your budget, you may decide on this Android smartphone without a second thought. We have got the Asus ZenFone 3s Max (ZC521TL) with 5000 mAh battery with similar pricing as well. But for some reasons it gave lower backup and we found some software issues in that phone. There is also no fast charging. So, Moto E4 Plus is ahead.
       <br><br> 
        3 GB RAM is also great for the price. However, if using high-end graphics related apps is your thing, you should not choose this phone because of an inferior 28 nm Mediatek MT6737 chipset and quad-core CPU. Xiaomi Redmi 6 is the phone to go for if the best possible performance for the budget is what you are searching for. But Moto E4 Plus is well-able to handle everyday multitasking and app using smoothly. Messengers, video calling, 4G internet browsing, YouTube video playback may not show any lag.
        <br><br>
        13 MP autofocus back camera and 5 MP front camera with flash and f/2.0 are pretty decent. The shots are pretty natural and authentic like Samsung or Nokia phones in this price range. We were overall quite satisfied with the colors, sharpness, brightness and even low-light shots. Among other features, we have got the Dolby Atmos microphones with excellent sound quality. There is a 16 GB ROM and a 32 GB ROM version. For more internal storage, you can use a dedicated MicroSD card up to 128 GB.
        <br><br>
        There is also a fingerprint sensor, but it may respond a little slower. The phone comes with a single SIM option which is probably its biggest drawback. Another disadvantage is that there is no Full HD video recording possibility (only HD). We also couldn’t find any info about OTG support. Altogether, there are a few negatives, but the overall specs are highly attractive especially for mature users and the older generation who prioritize stable, long-term and comfortable use with essential features.
