    <h2 style="text-align: center"><u>Highlights</u></h2><br>
   

    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">Nokia 3.1 Plus is a good news especially for Nokia fans who weren’t quite satisfied with the previously released Nokia 3.1 in May 2018. This one has a much-improved camera, better video recording quality, fingerprint, bigger display, more powerful battery and higher performance just for an added BDT 1,000/=. This is an exciting release for low-mid range users who prefer the quality, long reputation and durability of Nokia over Xiaomi and co.s overwhelming features. Nokia’s hardware and software quality are among the top brands still in 2018 with their releases so far. If you want to use your phone over a long period with consistent performance, security updates and solid body, Nokia stands out in the crowd.
<br><br>
        The design of this gadget is among its most admirable facts. The body is made of aluminum and the front glass is toughened. It will not be as strong as the latest generation Gorilla Glass but still way stronger than a regular display. The screen is a 6-inch IPS LCD one with a full-view design. But the resolution is just HD+ which is probably its biggest drawback. A full HD+ display would have been sensational. The design is impressively slim considering that there is a 3500 mAh big battery packed inside. It should give a regular user about two days of backup and a power user may get a whole day which is creditable for the price. But there is no fast charging and we hardly know of any device that provides fast charge for the price, so it’s fine.
        <br><br>
        Nokia 3.1 Plus comes with a Mediatek Helio P22 chipset which is a competitor of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 450. You may think it’s not that much. But Nokia’s software optimization will make it perform much better than a regular Snapdragon 450 phone. There is 2 GHz octa-core CPU and 3 GB RAM as well. But an even better fact is that the phone comes with Android One. It means blazing fast and minimal interface (UI). You can also delete any app you want including the built-in Google apps (except the Nokia camera app) which further optimizes the performance. But don’t expect Snapdragon 660 performance from it when using graphics-intensive apps.
        <br><br>
        Camera is way more improved than the previous release, but it is still quite on the average side. The details are not very deep and you may get overexposure under too much daylight. Autofocus and low-light shots are not up to the mark as well. But the shots are very natural and authentic looking. There is no cheap skin toning or softening with poor face beauty or AI software. The daylight shots are pretty decent too.
        <br><br><br>
        You get a fingerprint feature, 32 GB ROM, up to 400 GB MicroSD, OTG, NFC and dual SIM option. It should also get the Android 10 update.
