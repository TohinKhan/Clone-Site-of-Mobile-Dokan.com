    <p>Xiaomi is a well-established and worldwide well-known Chinese smartphone manufacturer of today. As of Q2 2021,
        they are the second most popular smartphone brand of the world (after Samsung) with 16.9% market share (IDC).
        The reasons behind the success of Xiaomi are few. First of all, they have something to offer in about any price
        range, from low to very high. Then, Xiaomi phones have a reputation for stable software and hardware quality.
        Their phones usually offer a fine combination of specs with attractive pricing to meet consumer expectations.
        The modern and elegant design of their phones is also noticeable. Xiaomi phones are also known for their smooth
        and consistent performance offered for the low-mid and mid-range consumers. Battery life and camera quality are
        usually admirable as well. Moreover, they have a comprehensive insight into the buyer demand in various regions
        and budget groups. Enthusiasm, generosity, expertise and vision are some words that explain Xiaomi well.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>Xiaomi is a relatively new brand in the phone industry. Their first smartphone Xiaomi Mi 1 was released back in
        August 2011. But within a very short period, at the end of 2014, they became the number one smartphone brand in
        the competitive market of China which was a country of 1.4 Billion people at that time. After China, Xiaomi has
        expanded its business to the USA and gained an excellent response from the consumers. But they have aimed high
        and decided to become one of the major brands in the global smartphone scene. Their success in China and in the
        USA helped them achieve this goal in less than three years. By the end of 2017, they were among the five
        top-selling smartphone brands in the world. In January 2019, Xiaomi opened the biggest Mi Store of Europe in
        Paris to establish their strong presence and continuous growth in Europe.</p>

    <h2>Xiaomi in Bangladesh</h2>

    <p>On 10th August 2016, Xiaomi introduced their smartphones in Bangladesh in a conference in Grameenphone Corporate
        Office. Xiaomi primarily launched three smartphones in the Bangladeshi market together with Grameenphone and
        their authorized distributor in Bangladesh Solar Electro BD. It took only about half a year for them to gain a
        significant amount of consumer response. It all started with the launch of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 in February 2017.
        This low-mid range phone was “the ultimate smartphone” for its time for a vast number of smartphone enthusiasts
        in Bangladesh. The features were exceptionally versatile, the design was simply elegant, the performance was
        superior and the price was unbeatable. After that, they kept producing impressive phones to draw new buyers. At
        the beginning of 2018, they became the most searched smartphone brand online in Bangladesh. Brands like Samsung,
        Symphony or Oppo were behind them. Then in 17th July 2018, Xiaomi officially entered Bangladeshi market with its
        own brand entity. Now, they are operating the business by themselves and not through their local distributor.
        Xiaomi is among the top brands to the young generation of Bangladesh in 2021. Redmi Note 10 and Note 10 Pro
        along with Poco M3 and Poco X3 NFC are some of their most successful recent releases. Xiaomi plans to establish
        a manufacturing factory in Bangladesh in the near future.</p>
