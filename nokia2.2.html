    <h2 style="text-align: center"><u>Highlights</u></h2>

    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">There are a few exciting facts about Nokia 2.2. First of all, it is the officially lowest priced Android One powered smartphone in Bangladesh as of July 2019. The 2 GB RAM version costs only 10,999 Tk. The chipset is a MediaTek Helio A22 and the CPU is quad-core which makes this phone unfit for bigger games such as PUBG. However, smaller games can be run quite smoothly also with the support of fairly decent PowerVR GE8320 GPU. Light apps usage and day to day multitasking should be ok for long-term. The 3 GB version for 12,999 TK. wouldn’t make a big difference in terms of gaming as the chipset and CPU stay the same and there is also no fingerprint sensor. So, we suggest to go for the 2 GB version if 10,999 Tk. is your maximum budget. If you want to run games like PUBG more smoothly, want fingerprint sensor and better camera, Xiaomi Redmi 7 (3 GB version) is a good choice. Vivo Y93 or Nokia 4.2 are some other choices. Oppo A5s or Samsung Galaxy M20 are some more superior choices for a slightly higher price. But let’s stick with Nokia 2.2 for now.

        The device comes with a 5.71 inches HD+ display. The phone weighs just 153 grams. So, it is a very light and compact phone with a comfortable grip. The backside has a glossy finish and can be considered as a fingerprint and dust magnet. So, a decent back cover is suggested. The rounded shaped waterdrop notch display with the compact design looks quite nice. Logo placement etc. also looks very modern and up to date. So, it gets an excellent mark when it comes to design.
        
        You may think that 3000 mAh battery isn’t a big deal. Many phones are offering 4000 mAh battery with 10W fast charging around the price. However, Nokia 2.2 is running on stock Android out of the box and the display is just 5.71″. So, 3000 mAh battery can provide much higher backup than one may usually assume. Since the battery is also small, the regular 5V/1A charger can charge the battery faster too. So, it is quite a decent and fair deal when it comes to the battery. Moreover, it is removable and comes with the crazy standard of Nokia.
        
        There is no fingerprint sensor on this phone, which is indeed a pity. However, we have got a fast biometric face unlocking system. Personally, I am not a big fan of face unlocking as it doesn’t work in the dark and it is quite uncomfortable to use it in many outdoor scenarios. So, no fingerprint is a drawback for users like me.We are not sure if this phone comes with a notification light. We couldn’t find any official information on that after doing enough research. There is the always-on display feature which can be seen as a decent alternative to LED notification light in case it is not available. 13 MP single back camera and 5 MP front camera are pretty okay for the price, especially when it comes to the 2 GB version. However, there is no portrait mode with bokeh effect, wide-angle lens, night mode or depth sensor etc. So, they will do just fine for everyday mobile photography, but you can’t take it to the next level. Overall, if you are looking for a light, compact, sweet and durable smartphone for long-term light usage, Nokia 2.2 is an elegant option for the price.
