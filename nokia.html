    <p><b>Nokia, a Finnish company,</b> used to be <b>the most popular brand since the birth of mobile phones in Bangladesh</b> and there are specific reasons behind it. It was able to win the hearts of millions of people with its affordable price, elegant design, simplistic approach and outstanding features. Not just in Bangladesh, if one looks at history, <b>most top selling phones in the world are from this brand in the pre-smartphone era.</b> Nokia has been manufacturing a wide range of phones with very different kind of specifications and facilities.</p>
    <h3>History of Nokia Phones</h3>
    <p>Nokia 1110, 1200, N8, 2600, E71, 6610 were some of the stunning devices from this classy brand at the beginning of the feature phone era. Then the modern operating system based smartphones came into the market and Nokia started to manufacture Windows phones. They gained high-reputation for introducing extraordinary and very powerful cameras into their phones back then. <b>41-megapixel spectacular camera with Carl Zeiss Optics in Lumia 1020</b> was a big headline in 2013. Lumia 1520 was another massive flagship release in the same year. The Nokia Asha series made a name to casual smartphone users. The Asha 501 would be one great example of this series. At the beginning of 2014, Nokia introduced <b>&#8220;The Nokia X Family&#8221; which were the first three Android devices from this brand</b>. But then they sold their brand name to Microsoft. At the end of 2014, the brand Nokia officially became Microsoft Mobile and they started to manufacture smartphones under the name &#8220;Microsoft Lumia&#8221;. But Windows phone wasn&#8217;t altogether as successful as both Nokia and Microsoft expected it to be. So, Microsoft resigned from phone business in Bangladesh in 2016.</p>
    <h3>The Great Comeback of Nokia</h3>
    <p><b>After finishing the contract with Microsoft in mid-2017, Nokia decided to move entirely to Android with their old branding</b> and introduced Nokia 3, 5 and 6 along with a feature phone Nokia 3310 (2017 version). The feature phone was a remake of their old classic Nokia 3310. With these phones, Nokia once again made a big impression and gained a significant amount of consumer interest. In 2018, they got even better by introducing four new Android phones and a 4G feature phone in Mobile World Congress. Among them was the low budget smart Nokia 1. It could truly give their identity back in a modern smartphone era. Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 8110 (4G) has also been some significant announcements. With these devices and further releases, Nokia finally became a complete brand. The pricing, elegance, charm, durability, build quality, camera, performance, sound and consumer interest are in harmony, again.</p>
    <h3>Current State of Nokia in Bangladesh</h3>
    <p>Nokia phones are distributed in Bangladesh through HMD Global. Nokia is again the most trustworthy name in the feature phone industry of Bangladesh with successful releases like Nokia 3310 (2017), Nokia 105, Nokia 216 and so on. Their Low range smartphones such as Nokia 1, Nokia 2 and Nokia 2.1 generated a good amount of sales. Their low-mid, mid and high range phones are well-valued for their camera, performance, sound and durability. Nokia is one of the most important names of the phone industry of Bangladesh and they have got all the potential to become the leading brand.</p>
    <p>In June 2021, Nokia announced to establish an assembling factory in Bangladesh. Shortly after that, they released Nokia 3.4 in the market.</p>
