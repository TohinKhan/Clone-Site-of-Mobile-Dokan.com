    <h2 style="text-align: center"><u>Highlights</u></h2>

    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">Motorola is one of those brands that ruled the phone market with the birth of Android and even before that with its “Razr” series. But with time, they started to fall behind in the competition. We didn’t see any presence of Motorola in Bangladesh in the last few years. They released Moto E4 Plus, E5 and E5 Plus at the end of 2018 which couldn’t make any significant impression because of unattractive specs and pricing. But now, Motorola is finally back again with a smartphone worth checking out. Motorola One is by all mean one of the most competitive mid-range smartphones in the current Bangladeshi market. Let us see why.
<br><br>
        Motorola One comes with Android One version most probably which is why the model is named like this. Android One means OS and security updates for three years which is excellent news. Furthermore, We don’t have any extra layer of UI which makes the OS runs much smoother and faster with simplified experience. The design looks trendy. Gorilla glass protects front side and the back side is also made of glass which gives a somewhat premium feel. 5.9-inch sounds just like a perfect fit for the hand. The quality of LTPS IPS LCD display is admirable. But the display is an HD+ which is in our eyes the only disadvantage of this phone. A Full HD+ display could make this device people’s favorite. But nothing to complain about the colors, viewing angle and under sunlight view.
     <br><br>
        Motorola One comes with a Snapdragon 625 chipset with 4 GB RAM and 2 GHz octa-core CPU. It sounds exactly as what you would wish for the budget. The power-efficient chipset, HD display, Android One and Motorola’s fine software optimization will make the 3000 mAh battery much stronger as well. You can easily go through the day. Moreover, we have got the “Turbopower” fast charging. Motorola describes it as 6 hours of power for 20 minutes of charging. Adreno 506 GPU is decent in this price range and you may not have any lag while playing any regular games. Excellent performance with precise and intelligent optimization gets a big thumbs up from us.
       <br><br> 
        Both front and back cameras are fine for casual mobile photography with creative touch. The resolution won’t be super premium, but the daylight shots will look clear and authentic with a fair amount of details. Night shots will have some noise which is usual in this price range. The creative “spot color” feature will let you keep one single color in the photo and turn everything else black and white which is a pleasant feature. Cinemagraph, Google Lens, Bokeh etc. are also included as advanced camera features. 4K video recording is a fine positive of this gadget as well.
       <br><br> 
        We have also got USB Type-C, Dual SIM, FM Radio, fingerprint, Dolby audio, splash resistant body (means it can handle light water but may get harmed under heavy water) etc. features. Overall, it gets a very good impression from us.

    </p>
    <p style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;"> Among other features, there is FM Radio, Dual SIM, face unlock, USB Type-C etc.
